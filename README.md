About this project

I have a friend who recently opened up his own pet shop (as named above) and did this site to help him get his brand out to the local market, place and to allow people to be able to contact him, register with his site, let him have a blog for his usage and for his customers to interact with him and to let him have a paypal store for him to do food sales online

Discoveries/functionality

This allows my friend to have have a web presence other than on social media, it will allow him to increase sales made online and also show case his work through the blog section of the site, also doing the front end in sublime text first was not my best idea as transferring it to python proved challenging.

Issues/Obstacles

The main issues i found with this site was taking a template i got for free on templates.com and making it bend to what i wanted it to do, making it responsive to all screen types and changing it to look like i wanted it to. The main issues where with bootstrap and css, being able to work on my local environment but refusing to work on heroku.Also getting links which i have installed on the home page to open on a seperate screen which once i found out how to do it was relatively easy. the Google map api was also very contrary to work with as it didnt want to work outside the local environment and was challenging to fix
